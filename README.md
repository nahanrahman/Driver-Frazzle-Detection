# Driver-Frazzle-Detection system
An AI-based system to detect driver fatigue using computer vision techniques. Includes real-time face detection, facial landmark analysis, and an alert system.

## Overview
This project uses computer vision techniques to detect driver fatigue in real-time. The system captures video from a webcam, detects faces, analyzes facial landmarks, and triggers alerts when signs of drowsiness are detected.

## Features
- Real-time face detection using Haar Cascade
- Facial landmark detection with Dlib
- Drowsiness detection through Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)
- Alert system to notify the driver of drowsiness
